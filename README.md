# HRnet  

### Description

WealthHealth, a major financial company, uses HRnet, an internal web application to manage employee records.  
The current system, built with jQuery, is outdated, slow, and prone to bugs, leading to frequent internal complaints.  
To improve performance and maintainability, the company has decided to migrate the application to React.  

As part of this project, I also published a reusable component on npm:  
ðŸ‘‰ [xd-react-custom-dropdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xd-react-custom-dropdown)
